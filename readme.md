Hi I'm Dave Alger. Thanks for stopping by.

Any question I get in email (personal or professional) will now be responded to with a link [here](https://github.com/run-time/ama/issues/new). 
That way *anyone* can read the answer!

### Guidelines

- First search this repo for questions which have already been asked
- Type a direct question in the issue `Title` and any additional details in the issue `Description`
- Specific code support type questions are better asked on StackOverflow (questions about coding in general are ok)

### Also...

- Follow me on Twitter [@DaveAlger](https://twitter.com/davealger)
- My resume is on [davealger.info](https://davealger.info)
